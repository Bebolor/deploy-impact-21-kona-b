## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>




## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
Kona Connect operates a platform called "Dots", a mobile application used for searching help.  To do this, Kona Connect's team identifies and classifies the social organizations, and with this information creates a database.  By answering a few question, users will be guided to the organization(s) most likely to be able to help them and their situation.    

The mapping of the vast amount of information out there and the large number of organizations needs to be approached strategically. This is why Kona Connect categorize the different issues and available help through the structure of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

###  Frontend (Client)
- Runs in all major browsers
- Has a mobile-first responsive design
- Is installable as a native application
- Provides access to information in the backend based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal selected

###  Backend (Server)
- Does not require technical expertise to operate
- Is flexible and extensible
- Is deployable on any infrastructure
- Allows adding of resources and content dynamically
- Provides responses to users based on text prompts
- Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if 
appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.
